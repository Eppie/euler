 *        Problem:  Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n.
 *                  We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the following properties are true:
 *                   i. S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
 *                  ii. If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).
 *                  For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains n strictly increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.
 *                  Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a set for which n = 4, only 1 of these pairs
 *                  need to be tested for equality (first rule). Similarly, when n = 7, only 70 out of the 966 subset pairs need to be tested.
 *                  For n = 12, how many of the 261625 subset pairs that can be obtained need to be tested for equality?
 *         Answer:  21384
